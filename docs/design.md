# The design of Small Steps Home

This file tells how the app works, and why. The plan of the owner gives
the phases and the rules of the product. This file gives the decisions of
the code.

## The parts

| Part | What |
|---|---|
| `DIY` | The model of a build and the calculations, with no web code. |
| `DIYWeb` | The pages: Phoenix LiveView. |
| `assets/js/` | The script of the page: the hooks of LiveView. |
| `specs/` | The TLA+ models. |
| `worker.js`, `wrangler.jsonc` | The Worker of Cloudflare: the VM of BEAM.com in a Durable Object. |

## The server

The app is a Phoenix LiveView app. `beam.com` makes one file of its
release for the WebAssembly runtime (`npm run build`,
`scripts/edge-com.sh`), and the npm package `beam.com` runs that file on
Cloudflare Workers. One Durable Object runs one VM for all the requests,
so that each page and its WebSocket go to the same VM. This is the setup
of mkfifo.com, the first app on BEAM.com.

The VM has no database. The app keeps no data of a user on the server.

One VM in 128 MB serves all the users. So a WebSocket frame can be 1 MiB
at most, a build from the device can be 512 KiB at most, and the
fallback of long polls is off.

## The build on the device

The build of a user (the house, its rooms and items, and later the vans)
is a JSON text in IndexedDB, in the browser of the user. The server keeps
no copy. The LiveView of a page holds the build while the page is open,
and sends each new build to the device.

Why on the device:

- The plan asks for a low privacy risk: a build can show where a house is
  and what is in it. With no copy on the server, a break-in on the server
  shows no build.
- The app needs no account for the first phases.

The cost: a build is on one browser only. A file export and import moves
a build to a different device (phase 1).

Why IndexedDB, not localStorage: the save is a compare and set, and it
must be atomic for all the tabs of the browser. IndexedDB runs the
transactions of all the tabs one at a time. localStorage does not give
this: a browser can keep a copy of it in each process, and a Web Lock
does not make these copies the same.

### The protocol

`assets/js/device.js` (the hook `Device`) and `DIYWeb.Device` (the
LiveView part) do the protocol. The TLA+ model `specs/Device.tla` checks
it with two and three tabs, with reconnects, reloads, a failed write and a
cleared store.

1. At the mount and after each reconnect, the hook reads the store and
   sends the text and its stamp (`device:restore`). The LiveView shows
   that build, or a new build. It takes only the first restore.
2. Each change makes a new build with a new random stamp and the next
   revision. The LiveView sends `device:save` with the text, the base (the
   stamp of the stored build that the change comes from) and its epoch.
   It does not wait for the answer: the new build is the base of the next
   save.
3. The hook takes the saves in order. For each one, it reads and writes
   in one transaction: it writes only if the stored stamp is the base.
   Then it sends `device:saved`. Else a different tab wrote first: the
   hook sends `device:conflict` at once, in the transaction, with the
   stored text, its stamp and the epoch of the save.
4. In the transaction of a write, the hook tells the other tabs with a
   BroadcastChannel. The hook of each other tab reads the store in its
   queue, and sends `device:changed`. IndexedDB runs that read after the
   write, so the news comes also when the tab of the write closes before
   the end of its transaction. The LiveView shows that build if its
   revision is larger.
5. When a save fails (for example, the device has no space), the hook
   sends `device:error` with the stored stamp that it saw.

The hook sends what it sees of the store on one channel, in the order
that it sees it. A conflict goes in the transaction, so it comes before
the news of a later write of a different tab.

These details come from the model and from the tests. Each one has a
configuration of the model with the fault, and TLC finds the fault:

- **The key is a stamp, not the revision** (`Device.revision.cfg`). The
  LiveView sends a save before the hook answers the last one. With the
  revision as the key, two saves of one tab can have the bases 1 and 2.
  The first one gets a conflict. But the stored build of the other tab
  can have the revision 2, and then the second save writes over it.
- **The epoch** (`Device.epoch.cfg`). When a LiveView takes a build from
  outside, the saves that it sent before come from a build that it does
  not show now. Their answers are old news. A new LiveView has a new
  epoch too. Without the epoch, a tab can show an old build at the end.
- **A new read replaces the old reads** (`Device.reads.cfg`). After two
  reconnects, an old read can come before a save of the queue, and its
  build is old. The property test with real LiveViews found this fault:
  TLC needs two restarts to show it.
- **The news of a write goes in its transaction** (`Device.news.cfg`).
  With the news after the transaction, a tab that writes and then closes
  can leave the other tabs with an old build.

Other cases:

- A failed write keeps the build of the page. The next save comes from
  the stored build, and has all the build.
- When the user removes the data of the site, the browser closes the
  database. The hook opens it again, and the save gets a conflict with no
  stored text. The LiveView saves its build again on the empty store.
- A newer version of the app can open the database with a new version:
  this tab then closes its connection, so that the new version does not
  wait.
- A text that the page cannot read (also a value that is not a text, or a
  text of more than 512 KiB) gives a new build. The next save keeps a copy
  of the old text under the key `backup`, and the page tells the user. If
  that save fails, the save after it keeps the copy.
- The page does not save a build of more than 512 KiB.
- A build of a newer version of the app stops the saves, and the page
  asks the user to load the page again.
- A push of the hook while the socket is down goes nowhere. The restore
  after the reconnect gives the build again. A change that the LiveView
  made, but did not send before the socket went down, is lost.

The tests:

- `test/js/device.test.js`: the hook and the transactions of IndexedDB
  (fake-indexeddb), and a property test (fast-check) of two tabs that
  send saves before the answers, with failed writes.
- `test/diy_web/device_test.exs`: the LiveView part, and a property test
  (StreamData) with real LiveViews, a fake device and reconnects, in
  random order.
